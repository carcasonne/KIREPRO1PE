Also not sure how they get 512 as their fully connected layer, when they only use 4 stacks of convolutions #Mby er jeg bare dum her

Idk if this makes sense? chatgpt says that if youre using
cross-entropy loss you dont need softmax
Do they use softmax before??? idk what is going on

A softmax activation function is applied on a fully connected
layer to get the probability distribution vector of class
